Check cardinal directions of a tile to see if it is drawable. If one or more return true, tile is drawable.
Maze should perform this on all cardinal tiles of the tile being checked (recurse 1x?)
Could also have GetCardinalTiles return a list and check isDrawable3 of each of them (instead of recursion)
